# Hi!, i am Niky n.n

I am from Chile, i like to learn about robotics and automation, constantly learning new technologies, here are some of the projects that i am currently working on along with my academic thesis:
## Personal projects:

### ![Kinetic-7](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kinetic--7-blue?style=for-the-badge)
A robotic arm designed for precision tasks. It's equipped with servos, motors, and a custom-built control system. This project is one of my most ambitious, and I’m learning a lot while building it

### ![ByteForge 1000](https://img.shields.io/badge/ByteForge%201000-blue?style=for-the-badge)
A cyberdeck built with a Raspberry Pi and various components. it’s a portable and customizable computing setup for personal and professional use, designed with a sleek and functional design.

### ![OptiLink v1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/OptiLink%20v1.0-blue?style=for-the-badge)
A project focused on **fiber optic data transmission**. It uses an emitter and receiver to demonstrate how data can be transmitted via fiber optics.

### ![SolarMBOT-X](https://img.shields.io/badge/SolarMBOT--X-blue?style=for-the-badge)
An upgraded version of the MBOT robot, with enhancements such as 3D-printed parts, solar panels, a front omnidirectional wheel, and various sensors for a more interactive and eco-friendly robotic experience.

## ![My academic thesis Project (robotic and automation engineering)](https://img.shields.io/badge/My%20academic%20thesis%20Project%20(robotic%20and%20automation%20engineering)-red?style=for-the-badge)
Currently working on my **thesis for a degree in Civil Engineering with a focus on automation**. My thesis project involves the design and development of an **intelligent, omnidirectional unmanned vehicle** for mining, using proximity sensors and other technologies to improve efficiency and safety.
