# Hi!, i am Niky n.n

From Chile, passionate electronics enthusiast with a strong focus on robotics and automation. i am still a beginner in the field, but I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies. Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

## Personal projects:

### Kinetic-7
A robotic arm designed for precision tasks. It's equipped with servos, motors, and a custom-built control system. This project is one of my most ambitious, and I’m learning a lot while building it

### ByteForge 1000
A cyberdeck built with a Raspberry Pi and various components. It’s a portable, customizable computing setup for personal and professional use, designed with a sleek and functional design.

### OptiLink v1.0
A project focused on **fiber optic data transmission**. It uses an emitter and receiver to demonstrate how data can be transmitted via fiber optics.

### SolarMBOT X
An upgraded version of the MBOT robot, with enhancements such as 3D-printed parts, solar panels, a front omnidirectional wheel, and various sensors for a more interactive and eco-friendly robotic experience.

## My Thesis Project (robotic and automation engineering)
Currently working on my **thesis for a degree in Civil Engineering with a focus on automation**. My thesis project involves the design and development of an **intelligent, omnidirectional unmanned vehicle** for mining, using proximity sensors and other technologies to improve efficiency and safety.
