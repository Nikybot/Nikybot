# NikyTech Projects

Hi! I'm **Nico** (also known as **Niky**), a passionate electronics enthusiast with a strong focus on robotics and automation. I'm still a beginner in the field, but I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies. Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

## Projects

### Kinetic-7
A robotic arm designed for precision tasks. It's equipped with servos, motors, and a custom-built control system. This project is one of my most ambitious, and I’m learning a lot while building it!

### ByteForge 1000
A cyberdeck built with a Raspberry Pi and various components. It’s a portable, customizable computing setup for personal and professional use, designed with a sleek and functional design.

### OptiLink
A project focused on **fiber optic data transmission**. It uses an emitter and receiver to demonstrate how data can be transmitted via fiber optics.

### SolarMBOT X
An upgraded version of the MBOT robot, with enhancements such as 3D-printed parts, solar panels, a front omnidirectional wheel, and various sensors for a more interactive and eco-friendly robotic experience.

## Thesis Project (Engineering)
Currently working on my **thesis for a degree in Civil Engineering with a focus on automation**. My thesis project involves the design and development of an **intelligent, omnidirectional unmanned vehicle** for mining, using proximity sensors and other technologies to improve efficiency and safety.

## Technologies I Use

- **Languages**: Arduino (C++), Python
- **Components**: Arduino Mega2560, Arduino Nano, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, servos, stepper motors, DRV8825 drivers, relays, etc.
- **Software**: Autodesk, Tinkercad, Creality Slicer, Creality Print
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: OpenCV, OpenGL
- **Languages I Speak**: English (B1), Spanish (native), German (A2)
